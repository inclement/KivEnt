<p>KivEnt is a collection of Cython accelerated widgets for the Kivy Framework designed to make it easier to create performant 2d games. The main goal for KivEnt was to be able to render many hundreds or even thousands of sprites to the screen without the user having to deal with any of the mathematical complexities behind dealing with OpenGL. Every renderer in KivEnt batches the drawing of its entities into a single draw call, and the assembly for the call is done entirely in a Cython optimized loop with all data being pulled from underlying C structures; KivEnt's renderers spend essentially no time on python overhead, freeing up precious time for your gameloop. For the user, sprite drawing looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>
systems = {'position': (x, y), 
  'renderer': {'texture': 'mytexture', 'size': (48, 48)}}
gameworld.init_entity(systems, ['position', 'renderer'])

</code></pre>

<p>KivEnt has grown to include physics and collision detection, provided by <a href="https://chipmunk-physics.net/">Chipmunk2d</a> (through <a href="https://github.com/tito/cymunk">cymunk</a>), and a custom particle engine designed to be compatible with the .pex file format produced by editors such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cbl.particlepanda">Particle Panda</a>. Plans for the near future include an efficient and generalized projectile system, as many games that go for a 'bullet-hell' style cannot afford to perform these calculations in Python, and an AI system for steering behaviors, for similar calculation intensive reasons. Although not difficult to build yourself, a default Animation system will be coming as well.</p>

<p>I consider KivEnt to be in Beta Version 1 at the moment, documentation is scant to non-existant and the project is really in need of some early adopter feedback :) That being said, it has been in active development for over a year and I do not expect the basic API for rendering, physics, or particle systems to change that much at this point. For many games that just want to display rectangular sprites and make use of circle and box collisions, I think you will find that KivEnt can already save you much time. You can find the bare minimum application (some of the system loads are extraneous but intended to demonstrate setting up these systems until more tutorials can be produced) to render something to screen <a href="https://github.com/Kovak/KivEnt/blob/master/kivent_tutorials/2_basic_app/main.py">here</a>. A more comprehensive run down can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Kovak/KivEnt/wiki/An-Introduction-to-KivEnt">the wiki</a>.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Type of Game is KivEnt For?</h3>

<p>The engine has really been built to favor action heavy, pixel art games that use 2d physics. Even if you don't need physics, if you have a large number of interactable objects, or a need for polygon collision detection, the speed and efficiency of Chipmunk is unbeatable for the low, low price of not writing a performant collision detection library yourself. If you are only displaying a handful of sprites to your screen, or you have a fairly abstract game like 2048, KivEnt might not do enough for you over just using Kivy itself to justify the added complexity. If you plan on displaying hundreds of sprites at 60 fps, and you don't want to get bogged down in the technical details, I hope you will consider trying KivEnt.</p>
